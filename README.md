# 🧀 **The Tower of Taste: Culinary Combat** 🍳  
*Ascend. Die. Rise Again. Cook Better.*

---

## 🍲 Overview

Welcome to **Tower of Taste**, a Unity-based roguelike where **arcane gastronomy** meets **soulslike recursion**.  
You are an aspiring chef in a world powered by **food-based magic**, desperate to gain fame and revive your failing restaurant.

Your salvation? A towering culinary crucible erected by the enigmatic **Mozzarella Maestro**.  
But this isn’t just a cooking contest—it's a **mystical deathtrap**, and every failed climb only fuels your obsession...

> _"You die. You rise. You climb again."_

## 📜 Story

You enter the **Tower of Taste**, facing a series of bizarre and deadly cooking challenges.

Each climb offers:
- Magical ingredients
- Kitchen combat trials
- Surreal revelations about the tower’s origins

You fail.  
You die.  
You reawaken.  
Again, and again...

At the summit, the Maestro himself battles you. He answers none of your burning questions—then attacks. You win. You exit the tower...  

Only to watch it **crumble**... and **rise anew**.

This loop repeats **four times**, each run peeling back more of the mystery—until you uncover the forbidden **Book of Bleu**:  
a demonic cookbook tied to the **cheese fiends of the Halloumi Hells**.

Your final battle takes you to **hell itself**, where you confront the archdemon **Gorgonzola Gaap**.  
After defeating him, the tower finally falls for good.  
You hold the Book of Bleu... and vow to destroy all cheese demons.
